        <p>Hello dear readers, as you already read in the heading, I am a very reknowned doctor who tells people about the importance of social media in the current virtual world. So let me tell you that whichever part of the world you are in, you just have to have a phone with a camera and internet connection to make enough money for the rest of your life.
            Many people ask me how social media helps you make money. It has helped a lot of people. Because, you get views online which helps advertising your shop/brand/product. Some social media apps even provide money if you get a lot of subscribers/followers, like facebook and youtube.
        </p>
            <p>Thankyou,</p>
            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
            <p>Dr. Doctor,</p>
